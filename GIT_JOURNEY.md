## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Different ports used (main used 8080, dev used 3000)
- **Resolution**: Combined both, added environment-based logic
- **Strategy**: Kept production as default, added development as optional
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 2: README.md
- **Issue**: Different version tags and description
- **Resolution**: Combined both descriptions
- **Strategy**: Merged features with clear environment labels
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 5 minutes
### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator
(similar style â€” explain the second merge)
